Add your mongoDB url to server (backend). If there is an .env or JS file, add it in there, which will be used eventually in the backend. For this app, you may have to add a cloduinary API and secret as needed.

Host backend on heroku or locally or anywhere else, note the hosted URL. It is your backend URL.

Add the the backend URL in the client (frontend) wherever it makes a call to the server. If there is a .env or JS file, add it in there. 

Host the client (frontend) on a server (netlify or heroku or anywhere else).

Enjoy your app.
